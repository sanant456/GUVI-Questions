# Problem Statement:
In a college, there are two types of students: Undergraduate and Graduate. Both types of students have a method get_fee() that returns the tuition fee. However, the tuition fee is calculated differently for Undergraduate and Graduate students. For Undergraduate students, the tuition fee is a fixed amount of $5000. For Graduate students, the tuition fee is the number of credits taken times $50.

Please write a Python program that defines classes for Undergraduate and Graduate students, both inheriting from a common Student class. The Student class should have the get_fee() method, which should be overridden in the Undergraduate and Graduate classes.

### Sample Input:

60

### Sample Output:

5000
3000

### Explanation:

The Undergraduate class overrides the get_fee() method and returns a fixed amount of $5000. The Graduate class also overrides the get_fee() method and returns the number of credits taken times $50.In the sample input, the Graduate student has taken 60 credits, so the fee is 60 * $50 = $3000.

### Constraints:

The number of credits for a Graduate student is a positive integer.
